Provide a poem and poem.py will match up a Spotify playlist with track names making up the poem. 

To run, you need to have Python 3.1 installed. If you do not already have this, you can find instructions here http://diveintopython3.org/installing-python.html

After everything is set up, simply run:
python3.1 poem.py "STRANGER! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak to me?"

As the program runs, you will the poem with matching tracks will be printed to your terminal. Some searches might take quite some time, so be patient :-)
